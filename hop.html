				<p>This section will contain information about some of my favorite Hip Hop albums. Hiphop is a genre which has been rapidly advancing and changing its form and style ever since its early conception. The earliest Hiphop albums are mostly unrecognizable to what the genre as become today, which keeps things incredibly interesting. For this list, I chose more current projects but there are a large amount of great Hiphop albums that are much older, I am just a fan of the newer stuff.</p>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> A Love Letter To You 3 (2018)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Trippie Redd </h4>
				<p> Trippie Redd was an artist that I had picked up on pretty early on his career and watched his escapades for a while since. I believe that this project was the best of his career and that, honestly, everything since has been a little disappointing coparatively. Almost every song on this album is a hit and features releviely unknown artists (excluding the ones that are the opposite). Overall, an extremely fun listen. </p>
				<h5>Top songs:</h5>
				<ol> 
					<li><p>Elevate & Motivate</p></li>
					<li><p>Diamond Minds</p></li>
					<li><p>1400/999 Freestyle</p></li>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> Luv Is Rage 2 (Deluxe) (2017)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Lil Uzi Vert</h4>
				<p> Luv Is Rage 2 is definitely my favorite of rapper Lil Uzi Vert's albums. The beats he uses and the topics he covers here make for an album that I want to play over and over again. This project, the three top songs listen below especially, are a large contributing factor as to why he is a top five artist of mine of all time. The songs on this album feel real all wrapped in a cover which already feels iconic even after just a few years of its release. </p>
				<h5>Top songs:</h5>
				<ol> 
					<li><p>20 Min</p></li>
					<li><p>Feelings Mutual</p></li>
					<li><p>How To Talk</p></li>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> Imperial (2016)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Denzel Curry</h4>
				<p> Denzel Curry is always the artist in the Hiphop industry that people point to and claim that he never gets enough appreciation. This is absolutely true and is more than proven on this album. There is no reason that this work should not be considered anything but an absolute classic within the genre but it is almost never mentioned. The wordplay and beat selection on this album are phenomenal and perfectly show off the talent that Curry has at his disposal.</p>
				<h5>Top songs:</h5>
				<ol> 
					<li><p>Good Night</p></li>
					<li><p>This Life</p></li>
					<li><p>ULT</p></li>
				</ol>
