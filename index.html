				<p>All of this music is currently available on all major streaming websites, but Brandon listens to them on <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> because it is what he is most farmiliar with. The different pages are broken up by genre so feel free to browse some of my favorite albums by the different genres they fall into. I have taken the liberty of narrowing each album down to its 3 best songs for a good preview but I would recommend a full listen through all of the albums listed.</p>
				<p><b><u>Each page is broken up by genre</u></b></p>
				<dl>
					<dt>The page will include the following information about each album:</dt>
					<dd>-A picture of the album cover </dd>
					<dd>-Copyright information</dd>
					<dd>-Album Title</dd>
					<dd>-Artist Name</dd>
					<dd>-Description of the album</dd>
					<dd>-The three best songs on the album</dd>

				<p style="color:#2D3047"> This website was created entirely by Brandon Landsberg. I am a Senior who is graduating this May from University of Wisconsin-Madison. After spending 4 years learning about Journalism and Communication Arts at this school, I felt the need to go out and learn a completely new skill that I cold use later in life, which is what led me to <b>LIS 351 </b> and the process of learning how to make a website. In regards to why I chose to focus on the content that I did, I love to listen to music. I listen all day and whenever I get the chance, whether it be just sitting on my bed, walking to class, hanging out with friends, its something that is integral to my life and I want to share my music preferences with the world.</p>
