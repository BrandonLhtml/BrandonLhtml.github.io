				<p>This section will contain information about some of my favorite Rock albums. Rock music is such a broad category so for this page, I chose to focus on albums which came out mostly in the 70s but with one in 1980. Most of these albums fall under a category of Rock music called Progressive Rock which was made mainly during the 70's and which has become a big part of my musical interest.</p>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047">Close To The Edge (1972)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Yes</h4>
				<p> Close to the Edge is an album which, I believe, showcases the best of what Progressive Rock has to offer. Although the album only consists of three songs, the band manages to make them count. The titular track "Close to the Edge" alone will have you wishing that this album were even longer. It is an entire symphony shoved into an 18 minute time frame with a multitude of sounds whose sections interlap with each other and play off one another until the triumphant return at the end. The other two songs on here are also not to be forgotten by listeners. Although this album is not the kind of music you can play for five minutes to hear your favorite song, but rather something you put on and listen to the entire run time, it is defintely worth the listen as these types of sounds can't be found anywhere else. </p>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> King Crimson</h4>
				<p> Despite being the oldest album listed on this site, In The Court Of The Crimson King certainly doesn't sound dated at all. This album provides a feeling that will give you the feel of a midevil court with a rock twist to it. The songs which this album produced are all so deep and rich in sound and are pretty varied in their tones. "I Talk to the Wind" is a somber and introspective tune while something like "21st Century Schizoid Man" presents an agggressive and expressive ballad about frustrations towards the war in Vietnam. This was an incredibly popular album at the time and the artwork for the cover is equally as stunning as the music is. Overall it provides an entrancing experience. </p>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> Gaucho (1980)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Steely Dan</h4>
				<p> Steely Dan are one of the most prominent and remembered Rock groups for good reason and although this might not be their most recognized and praised project, it has been my favorite as of late (possibly because I played the others too much). However, Gaucho is a far different sound than the band presents on their other albums. Although its hard to decypher the meaning of a lot of the songs on here, possibly due to a generational difference, I still believe that the music stands the test of time and can be felt by anyone who listens. </p>
				<h5>Top songs:</h5>
				<ol> 
					<li><p>Time Out Of Mind</p></li>
					<li><p>Glamour Profession</p></li>
					<li><p>Gaucho</p></li>

				<h2 style="color:#2D3047"> Fragile (1971)</h2>
				<h4 style="color:#2D3047"> Yes</h4>
				<p> Although I have already selected an album by Yes for a previous entry on this page, they are my favorite band of all time and I would find it hard to pick any other album to put on this page than the one that started it all for me. This was the first album that is considered to be Rock that I ever really heard and I have loved it since then. While Close To The Edge might require a more serious listening, Fragile couldn't be more the contrary. This album is made entirely up of very easy listens and catchy songs. Almost every song on here has a fun and nice sounding vibe to it. </p>
				<h5>Top songs:</h5>
				<ol> 
					<li><p>Roundabout</p></li>
					<li><p>Heart Of The Sunrise</p></li>
					<li><p>South Side Of The Sky</p></li>
